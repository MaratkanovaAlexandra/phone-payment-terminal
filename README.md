## Hi!

This project is done using **Next**, **TypeScript** and **Styled Components**.

At first a wanted to use MongoBd, but it's available now.

Then i wanted to use Amazon DynamoDB, but it's available as well.

So i decided it'll easier to write a simple serve myself. Here is **[link](https://github.com/MaratkanovaAlexandra/phone-payment-terminal-api)** to it. I used express and json to store the data because it's easier.
